  def install
    # This `install` block is a template. You'll need to modify it based on your project.
    #
    # If your project is a simple script file, you can do:
    # bin.install "wcssh"
    #
    # If it's a Python project with a setup.py, you might do:
    # venv = virtualenv_create(libexec, "python3")
    # venv.pip_install_and_link buildpath
    #
    # If it's a Go project:
    # system "go", "build", *std_go_args(ldflags: "-s -w")
    #
    # If it's a Rust project:
    # system "cargo", "install", *std_cargo_args

    # Assuming it's a script for now. Please adjust to your project's needs.
    bin.install "wcssh"

    # This test will run `wcssh --version`. You might need to adjust this.
